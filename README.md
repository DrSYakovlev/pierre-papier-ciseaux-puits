# "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors", "Well"

## Introduction and Rules

This little game is an attempt to extend the traditional "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors" game. It is assumed that the user is familiar with this basic version of the game. Featured in *The Big Bang Theory* featured is the five-weapon variaty of the game (by adding "Lizard" and "Spock"). Here you can play the French version called "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors", "Well" ("Pierre", "Papier", "Ciseaux", "Puit" *in French*). The new winning layout is shown below and is explained in the RULES section.

In this version, two elements ("Well" and "Paper") win against two weapons. This adds a strategical (biased) level to othewise random game. If you miss your good old "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors" game, you can play it by removing the "Well" and using three other weapons you get used to. It is not recommeded though to use this option during the game. You play with your pc and replies are generated randomly. You can play Best-out-of-three, five and ten. **The RULES section is Expandible/Collapsible to get the rules out of your way when you play**.

## Other features

### Play area
In the main body of the page, after the RULES, goes the play area. Here you can select the number of rounds you want to play from the drop-down menu. **This is the required field**. The page will issue the warning message if you do not select anything. During the game you cannot make any changes here. You can remove "Well" by clicking the corresponding button if you want to play a traditional "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors" game. See what you prefer.

Finally, the Play area is where you make your move (and check if you are lucky today). The icons will be highlighted when you hover your pointer over.

### Reply area

The reply area is located just below the play area. This is where the computer shows its reply to your bet. It also shows the number of rounds you have already played. For the "Well" gesture I adopted an "oil-well" icon from the Fontawesome collection.

## "Nice to have" features

It would be interesting to implement statistical analysis to process game results. For example, introduding "well" makes the game less statistical and more strategical. Increasing the number of rounds in a game will decrease the role of pure luck in you results.
